<h1> AIDE </h1>
<h3> Project Description </h3>
<p>Our software is aiming to help end-user, which are people who are not professional software developer, develop for the web in an easier and more exploratory manner. This involves providing visuals that gives better context and structure for the end user by organizing their code in a block like shape in a stack structure. It is to help novice focus more on the logic of their program and less on how to use the editor. With the proposed digital interface, end-user will have the ability to explore different sets of solutions and can grasp a better context of the software with the metaphor, blocks of code. </p>

<h3> Vision </h3>
<p>Design an editing tool that will help end users to create or start learning code from an interactive visual way of representing code. A tool that provides examples for them to explore and experiment with their code and integrate a version control that can enhance exploration.</p>

<h3> Features </h3>
<ul>
<li>Visualization and description of the code through the interface of the blocks of code in the Stack so end users can comprehended their code better.</li>
<li>Templates are used so end users can start with generic code block to give guidance and lead to exploration.</li>
</li>Stack by Stack is for a version control system that helps explore and experiment different sets of solution for an identical purpose.</li>
</ul>
